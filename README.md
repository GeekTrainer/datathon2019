# DS3: Datathon 2019
Welcome to the official DS3: Datathon Repository. Please refer to this for sample tutorial code, workshop slides and dataset instructions.

## Datasets
We chose these datasets because they were the most versatile, balanced and required innovative thinking. We are confident that the participants will come with several creative ideas for what they can accomplish with any one of these datasets. The datasets are the following:

- Google Local Reviews
